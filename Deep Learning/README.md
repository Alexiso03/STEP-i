# Deep Learning Task

## Task Scenario

An orthopaedist is a medical doctor specializing in diagnosing and treating disorders related to the skeletal system. Part of their job is to distinguish between a healthy person and a person with Osteoarthritis by looking at their knee X-ray images.

Osteoarthritis: Osteoarthritis, commonly known as wear-and-tear arthritis, is a condition in which the natural cushioning between joints — cartilage — wears away. When this happens, the bones of the joints rub more closely against one another with less of the shock-absorbing benefits of cartilage. The rubbing results in pain, swelling, stiffness, decreased ability to move, and, sometimes, the formation of bone spurs.

Osteoarthritis Condition

You have to create a deep learning model that can detect if osteoarthritis is present or not in a given knee X-ray image.

Dataset: 

The Dataset contains three folders 

1. Test (845 images)
2. Train (2350 images)
3. Valid (641 images)

The train is a dataset that you will use to train your model.

The test is a dataset that you will use to test your model and find out the accuracy and confusion matrix.

Each of these folders has two folders 

1. Test:
 - Normal
 - Osteoarthritis
2. Train
 - Normal
 - Osteoarthritis
3. Valid
 - Normal
 - Osteoarthritis

Task:

Your task is to create a deep learning model that can provide the probability of having osteoarthritis for a given knee X-ray image.
